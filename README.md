# RS-Playground
Rust playground using [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example).

# Get Started
In `src` directory can find modules that should match Rust By Example structure. Each module should have an implementation of activities in each section. The code in `main.rs` should have a function that uses relative modules and print out the solution for each section. To checkout the solution, go to `main.rs` and uncomment the function for the module and run `cargo run`.
